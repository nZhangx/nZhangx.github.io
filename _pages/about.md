Hello, I'm Nicole, currently an MD-PhD student at McGill University. The [MD-PhD program](https://www.mcgill.ca/medadmissions/programs/mdcm-phd) is a combined medicine, research PhD program which aims to produce physician-scientists. My PhD is in the department of computer science supervised by Dr. Yoshua Bengio and Dr. Mathieu Blanchette. My research focus is on generative models such as flow matching and diffusion in medicine. The kinds of data I work with are time series patient data or cell sequencing data. I'm always open to research chats/collaborations. Don't hesitate to reach out!

Previously, I have interned at Deep Genomics where I worked on foundational models and developing RNA therapeutics for rare diseases. Rare diseases are often overlooked for their cost and computational methods are great ways to find treatments. 

Outside of work, I try to contribute to my local community by volunteering. It's a great way to find meaning and I highly recommend it. For more than four years, I was a suicide helpline volunteer @ [988 Canada](https://988.ca). We are also running a local watercolour group for elderly immigrants in Montreal to foster community connection and integration. Connect with us at [art4elderly](https://www.instagram.com/art4elderly/) if you would like to join our watercolour lessons or donate art materials for our students.
