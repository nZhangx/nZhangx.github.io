Hello, I'm Nicole, currently an MD-PhD student at McGill University. My PhD is in the department of computer science supervised by Dr. Yoshua Bengio and Dr. Mathieu Blanchette. My research focus is on generative models such as flow matching and diffusion in medicine. The kinds of data I work with are time series patient data or cell sequencing data.  

Previously, I have interned at Deep Genomics where I worked on foundational models and developing RNA therapeutics for rare diseases. 

Outside of work, I try to contribute to my local community by volunteering. It's a great way to find meaning and I highly recommend it. For almost 5 years, I was a suicide helpline volunteer @ [988 Canada](https://988.ca). We also are running a local watercolour group for elderly people in Montreal.
